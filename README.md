# MotionJS-pre-release

## Why open-source an 8 year old project?

Because it's something I can put on my portfolio/résumé, quite simply.

## Are there any games you can release that are using this engine?

No, sorry. I lost all of the source to my pre-MotionJS and post-MotionJS games due to HDD failure.

## What are the origins of MotionJS?

A long time ago I became quite interested in game development and indeed it's something I've experimented with on and off over the years, working with technologies such as Pygame (Python), LÖVE (LUA), SMFL (C++) and Unity (C#).

But in the beginning, my foray into game development began with web technology.

Around the time when the [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) became a thing, I for whatever reason decided that I wanted to try to make my own JS-based game engine/framework.

I had a few unfinisehd game prototypes under my belt by this point, namely a Worms clone, a Pokemon clone and a top-down physics-based space combat shooter.

But I didn't really want to make a game anymore, I was more interested in the technology behind the game. Plus the maths and the physics (linear algebra etc.).

Thus MotionJS was born.

I had no idea what I was doing from the very beginning and I was absolutely not a good programmer at all at the time. Here be potential dragons.

Also note that some of the code is based on code or ideas I found elsewhere, just rewritten in my own at-the-time style and in CoffeeScript.

## What is the future of this project.

Nothing, unless for some strange reason someone else decides to use it.

### Updates

There will be no updates to this project. Do whatever you want with it, that's why I released it as MIT.

### Support

There will be no support given to users of this project. You're entirely on your own.
